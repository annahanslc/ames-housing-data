# About This Project

Ames is a charming, urban city in Iowa, home to Iowa State University. Located approximately 30 miles north of the state capital, it is renowned for its beautiful great outdoors and low crime rate. These qualities make it an attractive destination for new residents. 

The Ames City Assesor is responsible for assessing all real property at 100% of its market value. The market value is an estimate of the price that it would sell for on the open market. 

The goal of this project is to generate a regression model that the Ames City Assesor can use to predict the market value of any home in Ames City.

# About the Dataset

The dataset can be found at: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

There are a total of 79 features, an Id column, and the SalePrice column. Id is an unique identifier for each transaction, and the SalePrice is the target column that the model aims to predict.

### Feature Types:

Based on the descriptions of the features, which can be found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), the features can be categorized as follows. 

##### Categorical Nominal Features: 31
- Cover a wide range of characteristics, everything from the shape of the property (LotShape) to zoning classification (MSZoning).

##### Categorical Ordinal Features: 17
- The condition of the home, on a scale, such as the quality of the kitchen from Poor to Excellent (KitchenQual).

##### Numeric Continuous Features: 19
- Most pertain to area, such as the number of square feet in the basement (TotalBsmtSF), and the square footage of above ground living area (GrLivArea).

##### Numeric Discrete Features: 12
- Frequently quantities, such as how many full bathrooms there are above grade (FullBath), or the number of fireplaces (Fireplaces).
